# Responsive styles

A simple syntax to add mobile-first responsive styles.

## Usage

Hope UI allows you to use an _array or object_ syntax to add mobile-first responsive styles. This relies on breakpoints defined in the Hope UI theme.

The default breakpoints provided by Hope UI are listed below:

| Breakpoint | Value  |
| ---------- | ------ |
| `sm`       | 640px  |
| `md`       | 768px  |
| `lg`       | 1024px |
| `xl`       | 1280px |
| `2xl`      | 1536px |

<Callout>
  Hope UI uses the `@media(min-width)` media query to ensure your interfaces are mobile-first.
</Callout>

### The array syntax

All style props accept arrays as values for mobile-first responsive styles.

For example, to make the `width` of a `Box` responsive, you can do:

```tsx
<Box bg="royalblue" width={[300, 400, 500]}>
  A responsive Box
</Box>
```

Based on the default breakpoints listed above, you can interpret this syntax like this:

- `300px` from `0px` and up.
- `400px` from `640px` and up.
- `500px` from `768px` and up.

<Callout>
  <span>To skip certain breakpoints, you can insert `null` at any position in the array.</span>
</Callout>

### The object syntax

The example above can also be written with an object syntax like this:

```tsx
<Box bg="royalblue" width={{ base: 300, sm: 400, md: 500 }}>
  A responsive Box
</Box>
```

Here, each key represents a breakpoint defined in the Hope UI theme, while `base` defines the base, non-responsive value.

<Callout>To skip certain breakpoints, just don't define them in the object.</Callout>

### Defining custom breakpoints

You can extend the default Hope UI theme to define custom breakpoints.

```tsx
import { extendTheme, HopeProvider } from "@hope-ui/core";

const theme = extendTheme({
  breakpoints: {
    sm: "320px",
    md: "768px",
    lg: "960px",
    xl: "1200px",
    "2xl": "1536px",
  },
});

function Demo() {
  return (
    <HopeProvider theme={theme}>
      <App />
    </HopeProvider>
  );
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Make sure to use the same unit for each value. The default theme uses **pixel**.
</Callout>

## Demo

Below is an example of a card component that uses a stacked layout on small screens and a side-by-side layout on larger screens **(resize your browser to see it in action)**.

<Preview isCentered>
  <ResponsiveCardExample />
</Preview>

```tsx
import { Box, Image, Flex, Text } from "@hope-ui/core";

function ResponsiveCard() {
  return (
    <Flex
      direction={{ base: "column", md: "row" }}
      border={({ vars }) => `1px solid ${vars.colors.neutral["200"]}`}
      rounded="lg"
      shadow="lg"
      w="full"
      maxW={{ base: 96, md: "none" }}
      bg="white"
      _dark={{
        borderColor: "neutral.800",
        bg: "neutral.900",
      }}

          Yosemite National Park is an American national park in California, surrounded on the
          southeast by the Sierra National Forest and on the northwest by the Stanislaus National
          Forest. The park is managed by the National Park Service and covers an area of 759,620
          acres (1,187 sq mi; 3,074 km2) and sits in four countiesâ€”centered in Tuolumne and
          Mariposa, extending north and east to Mono and south to Madera County. Designated a World
          Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs,
          waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, lakes, mountains, meadows, glaciers, and
          biological diversity. Almost 95 percent of the park is designated wilderness.
